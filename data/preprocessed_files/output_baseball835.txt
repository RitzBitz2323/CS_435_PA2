hey! whats this? agree! 

platoon advantage (sabo samuel) 

both players have reputation being excellent fastball hitters 
and both have reputation being fooled too often with 
slow curves and change ups 

sabo has more power and little bit better batting eye samuel 
noted agressive free-swinger sabo has more homerun power 

both players started game hitting below 200 

there may have been some game considerations that might have prompted 
perez want reserve samuel for use later but game 
*was* line and samuel never did get 

given all this dont see lot suggest pinch-hitting nor 
see anything suggest pinch-hitting there course 
clutch-hitting information but thats useless 

then again its not
