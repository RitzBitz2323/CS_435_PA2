those scientists can get around atmosphere with fancy 
computer algorythims but have you looked hubble results 
defects mirror partially correctable with software (see 
those jupiter pictures for results) but effects completely 
reversable why there going shuttle mission fix it? 

way see (and please astromomers give swift net-kick 
butt out ball park) astromers making 
best limited possiblities theres only one hubble and shuttle 
makes another near future non-thought perhaps those self 
same billboards could have small optical receptors limited kind 
mounted reverse sides mirrors (if that what used) 
and then whole thing becomes giant array telescope
