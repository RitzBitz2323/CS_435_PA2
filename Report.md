## `DocumentPreprocess`

Before constructing and analyzing our data structures, we needed to first pre-process the large text datasets. We do so via the `DocumentPreprocess` class, in which

TODO

## `MinHash`

We break this problem into two separate classes:

### `TermDocumentMatrix`

This class contains the construction of the sparse 2-dimensional matrix of documents and terms. After running the documents through `DocumentPreprocess.processing()`, we iterate over each term in each document, and then **we store the frequency of each term in its specific Hashmap mapping the term to its frequency for each document.** We use this hashmap to then construct the term-document matrix data structure, which is effectively an array of term-frequency vectors. Refer to the `TermDocumentMatrix` class.

### `MinHashMatrix`

This class contains tthe construction of the MinHash matrix data structure, a 2-dimensional matrix of documents and permutations (hash functions). **We assign each term to an integer via its hashcode, generated by Java’s `hashCode()` method.** **We then generate the permutation within the class `Permutation`, in which two large parameters, $a$ and $b$, as well as a prime number $p$, are selected uniformly at random to create the hash function** $\Pi(x)=(ax + b)\ \%\ p$. Refer to the `MinHashMatrix` class.

## `MinHashAccuracy`

Here are the results from one specific run `MinHashAccuracy.main()`

Notes for grader:

- these results may vary slightly depending on the machine’s random seeding for the permutation parameters.
- running with a large directory like `space` may take upwards of 30 minutes to finish processing, due to the time complexity of computing the actual Jaccard similarity between documents.

**Results from `MinHashAccuracy.main()`:**
```
Number of bad approximations: 
Epsilon                0.04      0.07      0.09
400 permutations:     16282       128         6
600 permutations:      4386        78        10
800 permutations:      5613        30         2

Total Runtime: 823.0s
```

We can see that as the number of permutations increases, so does the accuracy of our MinHash estimate. We also see that as the error threshold increases by even just a few percentage points, the number of misses decreases drastically.
